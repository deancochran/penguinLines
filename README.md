Overview

In data that changes over time, line charts are one of the best ways to see change.  However, when there are more than 5 lines it can quickly become difficult to see what is happening.  This is where interactivity can be beneficial.

There are interesting patterns in how well the students perform in their work.  As you plot the data look for the trends in each penguins' performance.
Retrieve the data

Your data is located in the classData.json file.  The images are located in the img folder.  Your first task is to correctly read the data from the JSON file using a promise.  Be sure to print the students out to the console.

LinePlot: 
For each penguin, draw a line showing the quiz scores of that penguin.  With so many penguins a legend and different colors would be meaningless, don't draw them.
Pointers:
Use the screen, margins, graph variables to layout the graph
Labels, Axes, and CSS are mandatory


Switch Drivers


Highlight

Add a hover effect for the lines(mouseover and mouseout are the names of the events). Have the selected line change color or opacity AND use a tool tip to display a picture of the penguin that that line represents.



Extra?

Points? On hover, also show all of the data points found in the line.  (The trick here is that I said show instead of draw.  Draw all of the points to start with and hide points you don't want to see with css.)

Slope diagram?  Research a slope diagram and create a second page that shows how grades changed over the semester.


Something else?  You have a lot of leeway on how to approach this problem.
