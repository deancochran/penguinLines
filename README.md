Points? On hover, also show all of the data points found in the line.  (The trick here is that I said show instead of draw.  Draw all of the points to start with and hide points you don't want to see with css.)

Slope diagram?  Research a slope diagram and create a second page that shows how grades changed over the semester.


Something else?  You have a lot of leeway on how to approach this problem.
